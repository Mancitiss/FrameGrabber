## Project Setup


As I wanted to learn the fundamentals with this project, I followed Apple's basic documentation. Which meant MVC with storyboards at the time.

Overview of main components:
- [`Application`](Frame%20Grabber/Application): Entry point into the app
- [`Scenes`](Frame%20Grabber/Scenes):The app's main screens
- [`Packages`](Frame%20Grabber/Packages): Modules extracted so far

> **Note**  
> This was my very first app without prior experience. Keep that in mind when checking out the code ðŸ˜‰ 

## License

See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Please [don't publish a clone](https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber/issues/5) to the App Store. It's very confusing for users.
Instead, play around with the code, learn from it, and create something new! Make your ideas happen ðŸ¤—
