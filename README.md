## About

Frame Grabber is my first app!

I made it primarily for two reasons: One, because I've wanted an app like this for the longest time. And two, because it seemed like the perfect project in size to finally learn iOS development and Swift.

I tried to make the app polished and smooth for the user. Besides the UIKit stack in general, there were tons of challenges and things I learned along the way:

- Designing a smooth UI/UX
- Implementing custom, interactive transitions
- Implementing custom controls
- Efficiently generating large numbers of video frames
- Efficiently filtering PhotosKit photo albums
- Implementing In-App-Purchases with StoreKit
- And loooots more!

Feedback is highly appreciated! [Try Frame Grabber on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/frame-grabber/id1434703541) and tell me what you think.
