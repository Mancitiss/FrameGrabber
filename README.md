## About

I made it Frame Grabber for two reasons: I've wanted an app like this for the longest time and it seemed perfect in scope to learn iOS development and Swift.

My focus was on making the app feel polished and super easy-to-use. It should be a tool that gets out of your way and feels right at home on your device.

There are not too many fully-featured and polished open source iOS apps out there to study. I wanted to make Frame Grabber available to anyone in hopes other beginners can learn from it. Keep in mind this was my first app so the code is nowhere near to perfect.

## Development

Open the project in Xcode and build. The app has no dependencies.
