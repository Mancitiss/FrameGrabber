## Project Setup

> **Warning**  
> This code is from my very first project before I knew anything about professional iOS development, tight coupling, dependency injection, or SOLID.

To learn the fundamentals, I decided to stick to Apple's documentation. 

The project uses MVC with storyboards. A few parts use view models. The Coordinator pattern navigates from scene to scene. iPadOS-specific layouts are implemented with size classes in code and in storyboards. Layouts support Dynamic Type and Accessibility.

Main components:
- [`Application`](Frame%20Grabber/Application): Entry point into the app
- [`Scenes`](Frame%20Grabber/Scenes):The app's main screens
- [`Packages`](Frame%20Grabber/Packages): Modules extracted so far
- [`SampleTimeIndexerTests`](Frame%20Grabber/Packages/SampleTimeIndexer/Tests/SampleTimeIndexerTests/): Some tests for a critical part of the app
